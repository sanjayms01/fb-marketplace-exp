# Facebook Marketplace Experiment

## Abstract

Does increasing photo quality cause the perceived value of a good to increase? 
As the world continues to go through a digital revolution, online selling of used goods has increased with the rise of platforms like Facebook Marketplace and PoshMark. Just like how in person retailers want to know how to best display their merchandise, individual online sellers also want an edge. If photo quality has a significant impact on perceived value, then online sellers will benefit from putting in the time to take quality photos. We design an experiment with four sellers who post 90 items for sale on Facebook Marketplace in four different cities. Each seller is randomly assigned to post each item with a control or treatment photo. A control photo is a low quality image of the item and a treatment photo is a high quality image of the item. Each posting features identical product descriptions. The maximum bid that each item receives in control and treatment is compared. This comparison and regression models show that an item in treatment receives a 50% higher bid on average than an item in control. With these findings, we recommend that sellers take the time to take high quality photos in order to elevate potential buyersâ€™ perceptions of their goods.
